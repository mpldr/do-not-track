# `DO_NOT_TRACK`

seriously.

## Motivation

This site has been started with only one goal in mind: making privacy easier.
We do _not_ endorse opt-out telemetry, but unfortunately sometimes reality is
just cruel. To alleviate it, we propose the informal `DO_NOT_TRACK` standard.
This at least makes opting out as simple as it can get.
